### **What is this repo all about?**   
   This is the source code for my upcoming Counter-Strike: Global Offensive themed game.  
   I have made the source-code public for transparency, and allow users to contribute to the code-base.  

   We have yet to achieve:  
   * A Sophisticated and Secure Back-End Managing all User Data (Stellaria)
   * A Front-End Manager similar to HTML/CSS/React/JS (SpectraXUI)
   * A Simple collection of Self-made and tested Modules (PlayPrism)
   * A Fully-Functional Weapon Framework (Starblast)



### **Is there rules??**  
Yes, you have to meet these following conditions to be a contributor:  
   * You are allowed to modify and test the game on your system.  
   * You are allowed to contribute to the project by forking, cloning, modifying, and then creating a Pull Request.  
   * You aren't allowed to redistribute without our permission.
